# Food Lookup

Welcome to Food Lookup! This project is designed to help users explore various food items and their nutritional information. The project is split into two main components: the client (frontend) and the server (backend).

## Getting Started

To get started with Food Lookup, you will need to set up both the frontend and backend parts of the project. This guide assumes you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (10.x or higher)
- Yarn package manager

### Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dzhembekir9/react-course-work.git
```

The project consists of two main folders:

- `client/` for the frontend
- `server/` for the backend

You need to install dependencies for both the client and the server.

## Client

Navigate to the `client` directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd client
yarn
```

To start the frontend development server, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the frontend part of Food Lookup on a local development server at http://localhost:3000.

## Server

Navigate to the server directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd server
yarn
```

To start the backend server, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the backend part of Food Lookup, and it will be listening for requests from the frontend on http://localhost:8080.
